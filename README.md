Programming Experience:


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.

So last year we made shopping lists, and an html website, we also worked with a-frame as well. During the end of last year we created a game, based on an intergalactic scenario. Overall it was the basics to get us understanding python, html, and overall "simple" coding.  


10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).

So this year we started off with the dice rolling engine, then moved onto a card pulling engine. After that we spent block 2 working with the VR headsets and learned more about binary and hex


What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?

Honestly the actual coding part of it, I love the ability to have the idle file at my finger tips and just turn it into whatever my mind can think up


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?

The remembering part, I feel like I always mix up what each command does and a lot of the stuff we did last year has kinda slipped my mind.


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.

My goal is to get to the point where when I leave this school I can see coding as a hobby, because I honestly really enjoy it.
